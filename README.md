# üõ•Ô∏è  Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset
#### Course: Python for Data Analysis I
#### Task: 
**Perform a basic exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset and answer some questions.**

1. Read the dataset correctly using pandas, using an appropriate column as index. What is the PassengerId of "Mr. Robert William Norman"?
2. Compute the percentage of survivors out of total number of passengers and the percentage of men and women out of total number of passengers. 
3. Compute the percentage of survivors by sex (i.e. the percentage of male passengers that survived and female passengers that survived) and the sex distribution of survivors (i.e. percentage of survivors that were men and percentage of survivors that were women). 
4. Display in a 2 x 2 DataFrame the probability of being male/female and surviving/not surviving. 
5. Display in a DataFrame the probability of survival/not survival of all combinations of sex and class.
6. Present 3 insights about the dataset, each of them relating at least 3 different variables, and support them by code and numbers.
